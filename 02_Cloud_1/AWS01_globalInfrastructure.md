# AWS Global Infrastructure

## Key-terms
An Availability Zone (AZ)- AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region. 

Region -AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where we cluster data centers. 

Edge Location - An Edge location is basically a small setup in different locations that provides low latency connectivity by providing static contents to be available from nearest location of the request.
What happens is that instead of getting the information from the source it just routes to the nearest edge location and delivers the information reducing the latency.
